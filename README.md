# Blackjack-Simulation
This is a simulation of the card game Blackjack using Processing, a subset of Java. In this simulation, the user can simulate as many games of Blackjack as they desire, and the program will run through them all and produce numbers that are consistent with real data from scientific studies.
# Customizable Settings
The user has the ability to customize the game to their choosing. These settings include:
- Number of players in the game
- Number of simulations ran
- When each player, as well as the dealer, hit or stays
- When an ace is counted as a one versus an eleven
# Notes
Because this program uses auxilliary files, when the .zip file is uncompressed, all one must do to run the simulation is find the file labeled "Blackjack_Simulator_Final.pde" and double-click it.
